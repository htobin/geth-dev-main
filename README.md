# Purpose
To create a simulated network of Ethereum nodes that can store Ether, mine Ether, and deploy smart contracts. This simulation uses *Docker* to create an instance(container) of each node. In it's current iteration, users can use the host machine's terminal in Linux and MacOS to access nodes and control functionality. Each container is running the Ethereum client *Geth*. This client is what initializes the nodes and keeps them running on the network. Nodes can be communicated to with the use of the *Web3.py* library. Web3.py allows users to interact directly with the nodes via their geth interface. Actions such as: start mining, checking mining status, check the ether balance, and creating new accounts can all be done through the host machine's terminal. Once there are a few nodes mining, users can then use *Brownie* framework to compile and deploy smart contracts onto the simulated network.

# Directories and files for blockchain configuration, initialization, and node interaction
- ## main.py
    - Uses the config.json configuration file to generate the Docker Compose file, key files for each account, 
- ## compose.py
    - Contains function to create different sections of the Docker Compose file. The Docker Compose file is used for container composition.  
- ## directory.py
    - Contains function to create Dockerfiles for each node which is represented as a Docker container. Each container is currently an instance of Linux. Dockerfiles allow the container to run automatically, meaning that software can be installed, files can be copied into the instance, ports can be opened, and running commands in the container's terminal.
    - Also creates the genesis file, which is used to establish certain conditions for the Ethereum network and the nodes connected to it at startup.
- ## keystore.py
    - Contains functions to import the key files. Keyfiles are used for wallets nodes that allow Geth to recognize which funds belong to which nodes. 
- ## nodes.py
    - Contains functions that use the Web3.py library to interact with nodes. 
    - Current functions:
        - Create dummy accounts, with 0 ether(planning to remove)
        - have all but the first node mine for ethereum to produce blocks for the blockchain
        - stop nodes that are currently mining
        - unlock all nodes for fund usage
        - check if nodes are mining
        - check balance of all nodes
        - identify a node to use, and look for a particular transaction on the blockchain
- ## /geth-dev-node_#
    - Contains the Dockerfile to create the container and image of each node
- ## /keystore
    - Contains the keyfiles for each wallet node, contains information that allow dev nodes to commit transactions and deploy smart contracts
    - keystore files are created when main.py is ran
- ## cleanup (Directory)
    - cleandocker.sh: Removes: containers, images, volumes, and networks from Docker
    - cleanfiles.sh Removes: node directories, genesis file, Docker Compose file, and node keyfiles
- ## clean.sh
    - Cleans all Docker artifacts and additional directories.

The genesis file is generated when main.py is ran.

# Contract deployment using Brownie framework: /token
- ## /token/contracts
    - Default solidity contracts
- ## /token/scripts
    - python script to deploy the contract
- ## /token/tests
    - test your contracts on your network.

# Running the program
In it's current state the host machine has local ports that connect to each of the nodes. Meaning that nodes can be accessed via "http://localhost:port_number
"  
## Startup
Running the command:
```
python3 main.py config.json
```
Starts the program. Depending on how many nodes you have, the program will generate all of the appropriate Dockerfiles and account key files. It's recommended to have at least 2 nodes, with one being dedicated to deploying contracts. In it's current iteration, the "start_mining" function only has all nodes with a port number greater than 8485. This allows the node using port 8485 to deploy smart contracts and have the deployment be recorded into the blockchain.


![3_nodes](https://github.com/htobin/geth-dev-main/blob/master/images/Network_overview_3_nodes.jpg)


## Mining
Once the network has been set up, it's time to mine nodes

```
python3 nodes.py config.json start_mining
```
 
To stop mining:

```
python3 nodes.py config.json stop_mining
```

To check mining status of all current nodes:
```
python3 nodes.py config.json mine_check
```

## Balance
To check the balance of ether for all nodes:
```
python3 nodes.py config.json balance
```

## Look for transactions

To connect to a node and look for a particular transaction on the blockchain
```
python3 nodes.py config.json transaction
```

Then follow the prompts: one asks for the port to connect to the other asks for the transaction number.

# Deploying smart contract
To deploy a smart contract, you must use the node that corresponds with to localhost port 8545.

## Adding a network to Brownie:
```
brownie networks add Ethereum name_of_network 127.0.0.1:8545
```

This adds a network that connects directly to the node on localhost port 8545

## Deploying a contract with Browinie
Make sure to be in the geth-dev-main directory
```
brownie run scripts/token.py --network name_of_network
```

This will connect to your node at the port 8545 and as long as there is another node that is mining and adding blocks to the blockchain your contract will be deployed. If you look for transactions 


# Future plans:

- ### Create a docker container to act as the local host, that way the network is more portable
- ### have a way to designate specific nodes to mine without having the specified nodes in order
    - current iteration: nodes.py only has all  nodes with ports greater than 8545 (up to 8546 + number of nodes - 1)
